same code, different text color, wtf? maybe i missed something?

todo:	
		fix excess margin in categories
		separate into different categories the guitars, bass and amps on index
		make colors more user friendly
		add multi-language support
		make pages for all products with detail-en.html
		make different categories with shop-en.html
		copy index.html source code, modify, and make other pages with it (register, sign in, etc )
		add scrolldown script to categories from carousel
		look up bootstrap library, maybe implement latest stable version
		only sell combo amps, or also amp heads with speakers? (maybe later when more important things are done)
