            <p class="col-12 pe-3 pb-3"> For people who never played music before, we recommend starting with an Acoustic Guitar! The Acoustic Guitar has a long history, being part of human culture and arts for thousands of years! Acoustic Guitars are perfect for beginners, because they require no external amplifiers, are lighter than their electric counterparts and help new guitarists develop techniques, which they can transfer to the Electric Guitar, if they start playing Electric Guitars as well! <br> The Guitar on the right is our recommendation for beginner guitarists!
